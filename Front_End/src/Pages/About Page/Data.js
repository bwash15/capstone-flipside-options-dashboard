        answer: "Tiles are \"cards\" that hold all the stock information that you chose. Tiles are custom built by you in order to keep track of your data for you. From the nav bar at the stop of screen select Tiles. This will take you to the tiles page to start creating a custom tile widget"
    },
    {
        question: "Add Custom List",
        answer: "Each tile will consist of a list. These list will hold a list of stocks. A great example of a tile would be TECH STOCKS. This list will hold all the possible tech stocks that you would want to save. To create a list click either the ADD OPTIONS TILE or ADD NEWS TILE. They both have the same features but one is for stock options and the other is for news. After clicking one of these options, you will be prompted to name the tile. Once you name the tile, you will be redirected to the tiles page where you can see all the tiles you have created."

    {
        question: "Search Stock Tickers",
        answer: "After a tile has been created, you can now add items to that tile list. Click on the EDIT button to begin adding stocks to the tile. This will then redirect you to the page tha tholds the information for that tile. Each tile consits of a list of either stock options or news that you add. Next you will need to hit the ADD OPTION or ADD NEWS. Once here, you can search a stock by its ticker symbol. An example of a ticker symbol would be TSLA for Tesla and AAPL for apple"
    },
    {
        question: "Choose Price Range",
        answer: "After searching for a stock ticker and a correct one was inputted, now we can add a price range. The price range will be the stock price that you want to see the option values at. The option value is different from the stock price. Say that TSLA is worth $900 a share, the options would vary depending on how far or close the date is that you chose for the option. A further date would be more expensive because it is less risky."
    },
    {
        question: "Choose a Date",
        answer: "Once the price is selected, now you can chose the date that you wish to see the option at. The date is a very important choice as it is in charge of how risky you want to be when dealing with stock options. The further out the price is, the less risky the option is. That is because it is more likely that the stock will perform in the intended direction that you chose over a long period of time. The closer the date is the more risky the option is because it is less likely that a change wil happen so soon. Pick a date that you are comfortable with when dealing with stock options and one that is according to your risk tolerance."
